# Velocity-Engine

three.js controller, frame-independent physics, auto-tiled textures, fixed sliding issue. 

### Before you run it:
- You need a modern browser (obviously lmao)
- Node.js installed
- Any code editor - preferably VS Code
- **Live Server extension** (You need this to load the textures, otherwise you'll just see a blank screen with a crosshair)

### Why I built this:
I was tired of basic Three.js controllers feeling sticky. This one has proper AABB sliding math so you don't get stuck on walls. Also, the textures auto-tile so buildings don't look like stretched garbage.
